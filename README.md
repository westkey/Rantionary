## Contribute

**Contributions are welcome.** I love new words! If you want to add something, be it big or small, send a pull request and I'll get to it within a couple days at the most.

## NSFW content

These dictionaries contain potentially objectionable content. Such entries should *always* be placed under a `nsfw` class. Rant will hide this class by default when loading dictionaries, but if you want to include them in queries without an explicit filter, do either of the following:
```cs
// From RantDictionary
myDictionary.IncludeHiddenClass("nsfw");

// From RantEngine
engine.Dictionary.IncludeHiddenClass("nsfw");
```
